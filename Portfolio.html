   <p> I am a person with deep interest and shallow knowledge in programming and mathematics . It has always amazed me
       how much a person with a good combintation of these two can do . I started coding at 15 and my first language was java which i
       got a great teacher of . I have since learnt c++ , c , python , js and html amongst others but java remains my loyal friend by 
       a large margin . I am into competitive coding for 6 months now and it has been great fun , My other hobbies are swimming , reading and 
       playing chess . I started swimming at 5 , read couple hundered quality books over the years and in college team for chess.
